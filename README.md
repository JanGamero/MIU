## Project Overview
This project involves developing a web page to display my Curriculum Vitae. The site showcases my skills, professional and academic experiences. The project is designed to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience on a single-page layout.

## Project Analysis

### User Profile
The target user for this site is likely a recruiter or collaborator interested in learning more about my skills and professional experience. This user profile expects to find clear and straightforward information about my personal details, education, work experience, and technical skills, presented in a visually appealing and interactive format.

### Architecture
The website is organized as a single page with the following main sections:
1. **Header**: Introduction with my name and profile picture, accompanied by a scroll-down button.
2. **Professional Profile**: A section describing my professional profile, key skills, and goals.
3. **Professional Experience**: A summary of my previous jobs, roles, and responsibilities.
4. **Education**: Details of my academic background, including institution name and degree obtained.
5. **Skills**: A list of my core technical skills, such as programming and web development.
6. **Fixed Contact Icons**: Fixed icons with contact information that can be copied by clicking.

Some of these sections are organized into interactive flip cards that rotate to reveal additional details upon click or hover.

### Visual Design
For the visual design, a soft, professional color palette was chosen, including shades of mint green, light yellow, dark brown, and grayish green, which give the page a fresh and modern look. The chosen typography is *Times New Roman*, adding a classic and professional touch. The interactive cards are designed with a flip effect, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for the user.
